class Cards(object):
    """
    The Cards object keeps track of the Risk cards of a single player.
    At the end of each turn a player receives a Risk card if he has
    conquered at least one territory during that turn. Risk cards come
    in three kinds: infantry, cavalry and artillery. At the beginning
    of a turn, a player may turn in a set of Risk cards to receive extra
    reinforcements, depending on the card set. There are four valid sets:
     - "infantry", consisting of 3 infantry cards, worth 4 armies,
     - "cavalry", consisting of 3 cavalry cards, worth 6 armies,
     - "artillery", consisting of 3 artillery cards, worth 8 armies,
     - "mix", consisting of 1 card of each kind, worth 10 armies.
    If a player holds 5 cards at the beginning of a turn, he _must_ turn
    in a set of cards.

    Args:
        n_inf (int): Number of infantry cards. Defaults to 0.
        n_cav (int): Number of cavalry cards. Defaults to 0.
        n_art (int): Number of artillery cards. Defaults to 0.
